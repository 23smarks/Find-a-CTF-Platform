# Find-a-CTF-Platform
 
Java GUI corresponding to a weighted decision matrix for various CTF platforms.

Slider values indicate weights applied to matrix. The CTF platform with the highest total score after the weighting is applied is recommended to the user.

This was created after planning a CTF competition myself and noticing how difficult it was to choose a hosting platform in different scenarios. I wanted to simplify the process for others somewhat, especially for those with no familiarity with hosting CTF competitions. 

Planning on adding links, images, etc. in future updates.
